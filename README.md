# PythonToPseudoConverter
an input conversion between Python and OCR Pseudocode


## IMPORTANT
There are two ways to make the code work..

- Upload the code into a Replit project
OR
- Ensure you have the necessary Python Libraries/Modules required

For example:
```python
import re
```
^^ this is a python library for "Regular Expressions", which is how the program is able to read user input and filter for specific queries and also for validating user input

> This program was initially written in Repl.it and ported to GitHub for archiving.
